# Obsidian: Task Marker

[![GitHub tag (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker)](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker/total?color=success)

A plugin to change task statuses with hotkeys and right-click context menu.

- **Completed tasks** are marked with `[x]`.
    - **Canceled tasks**, marked with `[-]`, can also be added to this group in settings.
- Any other task status, e.g. `[>]`, are considered **incomplete** (or in-progress).
- When a task is *completed* (assigned `[x]` or optionally `[-]`), it can be annotated with additional text, e.g. `✅ 2023-01-01`.
- When an item is _marked with additional task statuses_, text can also be appended at the end, e.g. `❎ 2023-01-01`.
