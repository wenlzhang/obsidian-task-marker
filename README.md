## Why You Need Task Marker

Task management in Obsidian can be challenging when tasks of varying statuses—such as open, completed, or transferred—are scattered throughout extensive notes like meeting summaries. Recognizing this need, we created [Task Marker](https://exp.ptkm.net/obsidian-task-marker), guided by two essential [PTKM Core Principles](https://exp.ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles):

- **Task-Centered Workflow**: Prioritizing efficient task management
- **Focus on Important Matters**: Helping users concentrate on what truly matters

### The Challenge

When dealing with lengthy notes filled with numerous list items, key information can easily get lost in the clutter. Consider meeting notes, where ideas, questions, action points, and follow-ups often blend into a single, overwhelming document. Without clear differentiation, finding relevant tasks during reviews becomes time-consuming and error-prone.

### The Solution

**Task Marker** was developed to tackle this challenge head-on by allowing users to assign distinct statuses to tasks directly within their notes. Important items can be marked and highlighted, making it easy to spot critical elements like action points, ideas, questions, pros, and cons at a glance.

Through intuitive status cycling and customizable hotkeys, you can seamlessly update task states while focusing on what matters most. Moreover, every task status change is timestamped, enabling you to track when tasks were created, completed, or updated.

Given the importance of accurate time records, we also developed the [[Introducing Timestamp Link|Timestamp Link]] plugin, ensuring time-based task management is built right into your workflow.

With **Task Marker**, your tasks gain clarity, context, and focus—transforming task management in Obsidian from scattered lists into a streamlined, efficient process.
